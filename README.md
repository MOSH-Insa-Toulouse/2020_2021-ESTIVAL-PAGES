# LoRa Project: Smart Gas Sensor

This project is realised in the 5th year PTP ISS at INSA Toulouse. A **LoRa-connected gas sensor** has been developed to alert the user about the concentration of health threatening gas near the sensor.

# Content

This repository contains: 
* KiCad PCB files: A shield for the gas sensor to plug on an Arduino Uno (made with KiCad)
* The datasheet: Complete datasheet for the gaz sensor

## KiCad PCB Files

### Overview
The shield is composed of :

* A home-made gas sensor (made at AIME)
* An amplifier stage for home-made gas sensor
* A commercial gas sensor for the calibration of the home-made one (Grove connectors)
* A LoRa chip for the data transmission
* A LED as an on/off indicator
